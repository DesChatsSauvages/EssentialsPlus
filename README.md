# EssentialsPlus
## Note: This plugin is obviously based off the actual Essentials plugin for Minecraft: Java Edition, and to not be mistaken as it is for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (PocketMine-MP only, no forks will be supported)

This readme file will receive more updates as we're developping this plugin, since we just started.
